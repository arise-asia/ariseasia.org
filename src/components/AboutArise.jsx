            It is almost two millennia since Jesus called His first disciples to
            follow Him. Since that time, many followers of Jesus have taken up
            the call to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth. Now, in the 21
            st century, the need for the Gospel to be shared and lived out in
            Asia is tremendous, and God is setting the hearts of people in Asia
            on fire for His glory and purpose.{" "}
            <span className="text-amber-300">
              The time has come for Asia to arise and participate in Godâ€™s Great
              Commission.
