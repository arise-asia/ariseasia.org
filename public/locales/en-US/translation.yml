    title: Arise Asia 2023
    text1: On 25-29 July 2023, over 1800 participants from across Asia
      gathered in Bangkok, Thailand, for the inaugural Arise Asia
      conference. This historic event was organized to unite and
      equip believers with a shared vision of advancing the gospel
      throughout Asia. We praise God for the powerful work He
      accomplished during these five days, as lives were
      transformed, faith was strengthened, and a renewed passion for
      cross-cultural missions was ignited.
    text2: This conference was created to inspire and mobilize a new
      generation of leaders, fostering collaboration beyond cultural
      and national boundaries. As we look to the future, we hope to
      see the impact of this gathering continue to grow as
      participants return to their communities, empowered to make a
      lasting difference.
