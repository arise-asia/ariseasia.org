    text: It is almost two millennia since Jesus called His first disciples to follow Him. Since that time, many followers of Jesus have taken up the call to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth. Now, in the 21 st century, the need for the Gospel to be shared and lived out in Asia is tremendous, and God is setting the hearts of people in Asia on fire for His glory and purpose.
